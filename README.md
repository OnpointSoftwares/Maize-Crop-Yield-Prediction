## About the Project

The Maize Crop Yield Prediction project aims to provide accurate predictions of maize crop yield based on various input features. This predictive analysis is powered by a RandomForestRegressor machine learning model, considering factors such as Rainfall, Temperature, pH, and Pests and Diseases Prevalence. The results are presented through a user-friendly web application built using the Flask framework. The deployment is made public and accessible in real-time through Ngrok, allowing users to interact with the system and obtain crop yield predictions.

## Features

- **Crop Yield Prediction:** Utilizes a RandomForestRegressor model to predict maize crop yield based on input features, including Rainfall, Temperature, pH, and Pests and Diseases Prevalence.
- **Flask Web Application:** Deployed using the Flask web framework for a user-friendly interface.
- **Ngrok Integration:** The application is made public and accessible in real-time through Ngrok.
